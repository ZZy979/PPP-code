1 To be, or not to be: that is the question:
2 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
4 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
5 And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
6 No more; and by a sleep to say we end
8 That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
9 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
10 To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
27 Than fly to others that we know not of?
